Use a More Accurate Model:

Consider using a more accurate pre-trained model. The MobileNetV3 model you are currently using is optimized for speed but may sacrifice some accuracy. You could try using a larger model, such as ResNet or EfficientDet, though keep in mind that larger models may be slower.
Fine-Tuning:

Fine-tune the chosen model on a dataset that is more representative of your specific use case. This allows the model to learn from domain-specific data and potentially improve accuracy.
Adjust Confidence Threshold:

Experiment with the confidence threshold (thres in your code). Setting a higher threshold can reduce false positives but may also lead to missing some true positives. Finding the right balance is crucial.
Post-Processing Techniques:

Apply post-processing techniques to refine the results. This might include non-maximum suppression (NMS) to remove duplicate bounding boxes and filtering based on the size or aspect ratio of the detected objects.
Data Augmentation:

Augment your training data by applying random transformations like rotations, flips, and brightness adjustments. This helps the model become more robust to variations in the input data.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Experiment with hyperparameter tuning. This includes adjusting learning rates, batch sizes, and other training parameters to find the configuration that works best for your specific data.
Use Multiple Models for Ensemble Learning:

Ensemble learning involves combining predictions from multiple models. You can train different models and combine their predictions, which often leads to improved performance.
Evaluate and Analyze Errors:

Analyze the errors made by the model on the validation or test set. Understanding common mistakes can guide adjustments to the model or the dataset.
Increase Training Data:

If possible, increase the diversity and quantity of your training data. More varied and extensive datasets can help the model generalize better.
Optimize Inference:

Optimize the inference process by using hardware acceleration (e.g., GPU) and optimizing the code for faster execution.
